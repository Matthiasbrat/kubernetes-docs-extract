Managed control plane: Let the provider manage the scale and availability of the cluster's control plane, as well as handle patches and upgrades. Managed worker nodes: Configure pools of nodes to meet your needs, then the provider makes sure those nodes are available and ready to implement upgrades when needed. Integration: There are providers that integrate Kubernetes with other services you may need, such as storage, container registries, authentication methods, and development tools.",

In particular, you need to select strategies for validating the identities of those who try to access your cluster (authentication) and deciding if they have permissions to do what they are asking (authorization): - Authentication: The apiserver can authenticate users using client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, or HTTP basic auth. Using plugins, the apiserver can leverage your organization’s existing authentication methods, such as LDAP or Kerberos. - Authorization: When you set out to authorize your regular users, you will probably choose between RBAC and ABAC authorization. Role-based access control (RBAC): Lets you assign access to your cluster by allowing specific sets of permissions to authenticated users. Permissions can be assigned for a specific namespace (Role) or across the entire cluster (ClusterRole). Then using RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings, those permissions can be attached to particular users. Attribute-based access control (ABAC): Lets you create policies based on resource attributes in the cluster and will allow or deny access based on those attributes. Each line of a policy file identifies versioning properties (apiVersion and kind) and a map of spec properties to match the subject (user or group), resource property, non-resource property (/version or /apis), and readonly. - Set the authorization mode: When the Kubernetes API server (kube-apiserver) starts, supported authorization modes must be set using an --authorization-config file or the --authorization-mode flag. For example, that flag in the kube-adminserver.yaml file (in /etc/kubernetes/manifests) could be set to Node,RBAC. - Webhooks and other special authorization types need to be enabled by adding Admission Controllers to the API server.",

This means that the existing certificates, such as apiserver.crt and apiserver.key, can be used for communicating with the kubelet servers. Separate Certificates: Alternatively, the kube-apiserver can generate a new client certificate and key pair to authenticate its communication with the kubelet servers.

Logically, each controller is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process. There are many different types of controllers. Some examples of them are: Node controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down. Job controller: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion. EndpointSlice controller: Populates EndpointSlice objects (to provide a link between Services and Pods). ServiceAccount controller: Create default ServiceAccounts for new namespaces. The above is not an exhaustive list.",
