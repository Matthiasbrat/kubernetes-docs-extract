## Yellow

- Both the kubelet and the underlying container runtime need to interface with control groups to enforce resource management for pods and containers and set resources such as cpu/memory requests and limits. To interface with control groups, the kubelet and the container runtime need to use a cgroup driver. It's critical that the kubelet and the container runtime use the same cgroup driver and are configured the same. There are two cgroup drivers available: cgroupfs systemd
